# EdTech Databases Project

## Overview

This Database creation project is a comprehensive database setup aimed at facilitating the development of a cutting-edge web application for educational purposes. The project involves the creation and implementation of a database to store and manage a vast repository of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across various subjects. With a focus on scalability, performance, and user experience, the project aims to provide students with a robust platform for practicing and assessing their knowledge.


## Folder Structure

- **databases/**: Contains the MongoDB database files.
- **code/**: Holds the Python scripts and code for interacting with the database and Google Sheets.
- **credentials.json**: Google Sheets API credentials file.
- **token.json**: Google Sheets API token file.

## Features of the Datasets

- **5000+ MCQs**: The database is designed to store a growing repository of multiple-choice questions spanning five different subjects, providing a diverse range of topics for students to explore.
  
- **Advanced Database Management**: Utilizing modern database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, the project employs sophisticated techniques for efficient data Certainly! Here's a revised section focusing solely on the features related to the database:

## Database Features

- **MCQ Repository**: The database is designed to store a growing repository of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) spanning five different subjects.
  
- **Comprehensive Range of Topics**: The MCQs cover a diverse range of topics within each subject, providing students with ample material to explore and learn from.
  
- **Structured Schema**: The database utilizes a structured schema to organize MCQs by subject, topic, question text, and multiple-choice options, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.
  
- **Flexible Data Storage**: Leveraging modern database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, the project enables flexible data storage and scalability to accommodate the growing repository of MCQs.
  
- **Data Integrity and Consistency**: The database schema includes mechanisms for maintaining data integrity and consistency, such as foreign key constraints and relational mappings between tables.
  
- **Optimized Queries**: Advanced query optimization techniques are employed to enhance database performance and minimize latency, ensuring smooth and responsive user interactions.


## Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository_URL>`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Configure Google Sheets API**: Follow the instructions in the Google Sheets API documentation to set up API access and obtain `credentials.json` and `token.json` files.

4. **Set Up MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your system. Update the MongoDB connection details in the code if necessary.


## Running the Code

- Run the Python scripts in the `code/` directory to interact with the Google Sheets API, fetch data, and store it in MongoDB.


## Usage

1. **Fetching Data from Google Sheets**: Use the provided Python scripts to fetch data from Google Sheets in real-time.

2. **Storing Data in MongoDB**: The fetched data will be stored in MongoDB for easy access and querying.
