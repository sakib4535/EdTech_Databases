# EdTech Databases Project

## Overview

This Database creation project is a comprehensive database setup aimed at facilitating the development of a cutting-edge web application for educational purposes. The project involves the creation and implementation of a database to store and manage a vast repository of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across various subjects. With a focus on scalability, performance, and user experience, the project aims to provide students with a robust platform for practicing and assessing their knowledge.


## Folder Structure

- **databases/**: Contains the MongoDB database files.
- **code/**: Holds the Python scripts and code for interacting with the database and Google Sheets.
- **credentials.json**: Google Sheets API credentials file.
- **token.json**: Google Sheets API token file.

## Features of the Datasets

- **5000+ MCQs**: The database contains over 5000 multiple-choice questions spanning five different subjects, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive range of topics for students to explore.
  
- **Advanced Database Management**: Utilizing modern database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, the project employs sophisticated techniques for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management.
  
- **Web Application Integration**: The database seamlessly integrates with a web application framework (e.g., Django, Ruby on Rails, or Node.js with Express) to provide users with a seamless and intuitive learning experience.
  
- **Dynamic Test Generation**: The web application dynamically generates tests based on user preferences, ensuring personalized and adaptive learning paths for each student.
  
- **Scoring and Analytics**: Advanced algorithms are implemented for scoring tests, analyzing user responses, and generating detailed performance reports to provide actionable insights for students and educators.
  
- **Responsive Frontend**: The frontend interface is designed using modern frontend technologies like React, Vue.js, or Angular, ensuring a responsive and engaging user experience across devices.
